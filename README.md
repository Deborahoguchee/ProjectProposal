## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The title of my project will most likely be 'Flappy Bird' 

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will just be the classic flappy bird game but instead of the normal background in the game, it'll take the bird through the Temple Campus

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will have the typical controls of the game. It will allow the player to first choose the type of bird they want to play with and then prompt them to choose what Temple University campus they want the bird to navigaate through. In the normal version of the game there are obsticles in the birds way. Since my game is based on the Temple University campus the bird will have to fly through important parts of our campus like the bell tower and lecture buildings. If the player flies the bird into a building, they automatically lose the game. The way to win is to navigate the bird all the way through all of the Temple Campuses. Once the bird is thorugh all the campuses without hitting anything then the game ends.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I'm not planing on using a project from any other class.

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I plan to do this project by myself. Deborah Oguche: Tul48016@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will at least have the format of the basic flappy bird game. I think it might be more complext to code thatn I think but I at least want the output of the game and to have the player be able to control the bird with controls.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish evryhting outlined in the earlier questions. I can accomplish the background being Temple University. I just need to take the time to figure out how exactly to do it first.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 
The best outcome for my final project would honestly be having the scenery of the game be all 4 Temple University Campuses and having the flappy bird go through all of them. I think this will be the most difficult part of my project. 
 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

MY first steps is first going over what I've leared in class so far about games and figuring out exactly what I need to do to make sure my game is a success. I also need to come up with a timeline for my project. This is especially important because I have to make sure that I'm staying on track with my work so that everything gets done  before the deadline.
